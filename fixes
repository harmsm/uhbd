070131:
When doing addH on files from MD trajectory, the program crashed because not
all HIS are named HIS.  I altered common/ProcessInputFiles.py so that it could
find HIS named HSE or HSD as well.

070201:
- Altered ParseCharmm|Uhbd.py.  Now sorts file_list before passing to main code.
- Altered CharmmInterface.py.  Made titr_dict and possible_his compatible with
  GROMACS pdb files.  (i.e. HISA/HISB/LYSH recognized residues.)
- Added UhbdSingleFunctions.py.  This module is exactly analogous to
  UhbdFullFunctions and performs prepares.  As a consequence, termini addition
  now works properly.

070202:
- Fixed removed SomeError except statement.  (Error would be raised as IOError
  in SystemOps).
