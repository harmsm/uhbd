0.6.1: 060522
    Changed output directory structure slightly.  Now includes subfolders for
dielectric constants.
    Used to be:
        uhbd_calcs/{0.1,0.2...} 
    Now:
        uhbd_calcs/{D4,D10..}/{0.1,0.2...}

Changed temporary directory.  Now writes out sane date.  Instead of random 
number, appends sequential letter.  Also now writes to $HOME/.pyUHBD instead of
script/scratch/.  (For multiple users).
