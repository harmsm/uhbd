0.6.1: 060522
    Changed output directory structure slightly.  Now includes subfolders for
dielectric constants.
    Used to be:
        uhbd_calcs/{0.1,0.2...}
    Now:
        uhbd_calcs/{D4,D10..}/{0.1,0.2...}

Changed temporary directory.  Now writes out sane date.  Instead of random
number, appends sequential letter.  Also now writes to $HOME/.pyUHBD instead of
script/scratch/.  (For multiple users).

0.6.1: 061219
    Moved pyUHBD into CVS.  0.6.1 release tagged to r0-6-1.

1.0.0: 070130
    Major rewrite of pyUHBD.  Changed entire underlying module structure.  Now
able to run full or single-site command lines.  Changed interface to comply with
GNU/Posix standard.  Able to titrate arbitrary variables (not just protein
dielectric constant and ionic strength).  Combined with addH to efficiently add
polar hydrogens.  Removed temporary directory structure (calculations now done
in their final directories).  

Tagged first CVS release as r1-0-0
