Known bugs/issues:
    2007.01.30: For single-site claculations, n_terminus addition does not work
                unless first residue is 1.  If first residue is 1, an nterminus
                will always be added (even if you don't specify the flag).  I'll
                probably have to rewrite prepares.
    2007.01.30: Still need to deal with nasty header business.  If your pdb file
                does not have a header line, the fortran silently mangles
                everything and spits out almost-but-not-entirely-unreasonable
                results.

Features I want to add:
    2007.01.30: Currently cannot deal with multiple chains, termini, or chains
                with breaks.
    2007.01.30: Have each run dump an output file detailing all settings
    2007.01.30: Clean up I/O (particularly for addH)
